Few configs that I use with my xfce4 setup.

 - systemd services are preconfigured for [WhiteSur](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-gtk-theme), but you can change it to whatever you want.
 - firefox userContent changes NewTab color scheme based on current gtk theme (light/dark)
 - picom config is to be used with [ibhagwan's fork](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom)

this repo probably will be useless for you
